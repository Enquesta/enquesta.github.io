## Welcome to [Enquesta](https://github.com/Enquesta)! 👋 👋🏿 👋🏻 👋🏽

Enquesta is one of the many events conducted as a part of [LA Fest](https://lafest.in/), hosted by the students of Loyola School, Trivandrum.

From 2022, all Enquesta questions were created using RevealJs and all the slides used during the event are in reality just websites. This enables use to
provide a web based archive of the questions asked.
